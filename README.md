#1: Introduction to Interactive Data Visualisation (17th October 2018)


The workshop focused on the importance of Data Visualisation in Machine Learning projects and demonstrate how to create an Interactive Data Visualisation Dashboard using Shiny (an R package).

Shiny is an R library for building interactive webapps. Shiny allows rapid prototyping and quick production of dashboards and interactive data visualisations. This is especially important in situations where putting a real data-driven prototype in the hands of the end user allows for better refining of requirements before passing off to a web development team. This allows to speed up the delivery process and reducing the dependencies on other teams.

To be able to follow the wokshop you need to have R and RStudio installed in your machines. You can install R [here](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) and then RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
